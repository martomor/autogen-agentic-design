## L5_Coding_and_Financial_Analysis.ipynb

This notebook explores the concept of adding coding capabilities to agents and using generated code to complete a financial analysis task. You will see two agents collaborating to achieve the task while also seeking human feedback. One of the limitations of tool use is that not all LLMs have this feature, which is where coding capabilities add a lot of value.
